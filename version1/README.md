My script begins at this point.

I have created a mock-up of the following website: https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/aes-encryption-decryption. This website was previously my go-to resource for password encryption.

The code is designed to enhance security by preventing shoulder surfing and enabling encryption/decryption without requiring an internet connection.

For those who are just starting, I recommend trying out this script initially to become acquainted with it.

It utilizes ECB mode, as opposed to CBC or GCM, meaning that no Initialization Vectors (IVs) will be generated.

For personal use, I believe it offers sufficient functionality for safeguarding passwords and is exceptionally user-friendly once you become accustomed to it.

However, please be aware that this script should not be your primary tool, as it may lack some security features found in Version 2. 

Once you are comfortable with Version 1, I encourage you to explore to my version2
