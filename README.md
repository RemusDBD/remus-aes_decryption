# remus-aes_encryption_and_decryption
my personal script

For those who are just starting, I recommend trying out <b>Version 1</b> initially to become acquainted with it.

It utilizes <b>ECB mode</b>, as opposed to CBC or GCM, meaning that no Initialization Vectors (IVs) will be generated.

For personal use, I believe it offers sufficient functionality for safeguarding passwords and is exceptionally user-friendly once you become accustomed to it.

However, please be aware that these scripts should not be your only tool. You also take your responsibility to keep your private key safety.

I use self-contained Python package for cryptography so the script do not store or transmit your data anywhere else.
