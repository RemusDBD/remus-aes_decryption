# remus-aes_decryption
my personal script

For those who are just starting, I recommend trying out <b>Version 1</b> initially to become acquainted with it.

It utilizes <b>ECB mode</b>, as opposed to CBC or GCM, meaning that no Initialization Vectors (IVs) will be generated.

For personal use, I believe it offers sufficient functionality for safeguarding passwords and is exceptionally user-friendly once you become accustomed to it.

However, please be aware that this script should not be your primary tool, as it may lack some security features found in Version 2.
Once you are comfortable with Version 1, I encourage you to explore to my version2 and 3
